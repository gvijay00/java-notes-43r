# Abstraction in Java

### 1. **What is Abstraction?**

* Abstraction is an OOP principle that **hides complex implementation details** and shows only the **essential features**.
* It focuses on **what an object does**, not **how it does it**.
* It helps manage complexity by **separating interface from implementation**.

---

### 2. **Why Use Abstraction?**

* To reduce complexity.
* To enhance code maintainability.
* To provide security by hiding sensitive info.
* To promote loose coupling and improve flexibility.
* To enable multiple implementations of the same abstract behavior.

---

### 3. **How Abstraction is Achieved in Java?**

* Using **Abstract Classes**
* Using **Interfaces**

---

### 4. **Abstract Class**

* Cannot be instantiated directly.
* Can contain abstract methods (no body) and concrete methods (with body).
* Subclasses must implement all abstract methods or be abstract themselves.

**Syntax Example:**

```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound(); // abstract method

    void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    }
}
```

---

### 5. **Interface**

* Provides 100% abstraction (before Java 8).
* All methods are abstract by default.
* Since Java 8, interfaces can have default and static methods with implementation.
* Supports multiple inheritance.

**Syntax Example:**

```java
interface Animal {
    void sound();  // implicitly public and abstract
}
```

### 6. **Difference Between Abstract Class and Interface**

| Feature              | Abstract Class                 | Interface                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Methods              | Abstract + concrete methods    | Abstract methods (default & static allowed) |
| Variables            | Instance variables allowed     | Only public static final constants          |
| Multiple Inheritance | Not supported                  | Supported                                   |
| Constructors         | Allowed                        | Not allowed                                 |
| Usage                | For shared base class behavior | For contract specification                  |

### 7. **Example of Abstract Class Implementation**

```java
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void start();

    void stop() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle stopped.");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car started with key.");
    }
}
```

---

### 8. **Example of Interface Implementation**

```java
interface Vehicle {
    void start();
    void stop();
}

class Bike implements Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Bike started with button.");
    }

    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Bike stopped.");
    }
}
```

---

### 9. **Helper Class Pattern for Abstraction**

* Implement all abstract methods in a concrete subclass.
* Create a **helper class** with a **helper method** that returns an instance of the implemented concrete class but typed as the abstract class.
* This **hides the concrete implementation** from the user and promotes loose coupling.

---

### 10. **Example: Abstract Class + Helper Class**

```java
// Abstract class with abstract method
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound();

    void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    }
}

// Concrete implementation
class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

// Helper class to return abstract type object
class AnimalHelper {
    public static Animal getAnimal() {
        return new Dog();  // returning concrete class instance as abstract type
    }
}

// Testing the abstraction with helper
public class TestAbstractionHelper {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal = AnimalHelper.getAnimal();

        myAnimal.sound();  // Dog barks
        myAnimal.sleep();  // Sleeping...
    }
}
```

---

### 11. **Explanation**

* `Animal` is abstract, cannot be instantiated directly.
* `Dog` is a concrete subclass implementing `sound()`.
* `AnimalHelper.getAnimal()` hides the concrete class from client code by returning `Animal` type.
* Client works with the abstract class only, increasing **abstraction and flexibility**.
* You can change `Dog` to another subclass in `AnimalHelper` without changing client code.

---

### 12. **Key Points to Remember**

* Abstraction hides implementation and shows only relevant details.
* Abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods.
* Interfaces provide full abstraction but can also have default methods (Java 8+).
* Concrete classes implement all abstract methods.
* Helper classes can be used to **return objects of concrete classes typed as abstract classes** to hide implementations.
* This pattern promotes loose coupling and better design.

---

### 13. **When to Use Abstraction?**

* When you want to separate interface from implementation.
* When you want to enforce a contract for subclasses.
* When you want to hide internal implementation details.
* When designing frameworks or APIs.
* When different implementations share common behavior.
